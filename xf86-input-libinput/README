The X.Org libinput driver is a thin wrapper around libinput and allows
for libinput to be used for input devices in X. This driver can be used
as as drop-in replacement for evdev and synaptics.

Note: Copy 99-libinput.conf from doc dir to /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/
Edit it if needed, restart X and libinput driver will take over your device.
