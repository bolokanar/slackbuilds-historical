# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

htmlcxx: htmlcxx (A simple non-validating css1 and html parser for C++)
htmlcxx:
htmlcxx: htmlcxx is a simple non-validating css1 and html parser for C++.
htmlcxx: Although there are several other html parsers available, htmlcxx has
htmlcxx: some characteristics that make it unique.
htmlcxx: The parsing politics of htmlcxx were created trying to mimic mozilla
htmlcxx: firefox (http://www.mozilla.org) behavior. So you should expect
htmlcxx: parse trees similar to those create by firefox. However, differently
htmlcxx: from firefox, htmlcxx does not insert non-existent stuff in your
htmlcxx: html. Therefore, serializing the DOM tree gives exactly the same
htmlcxx: bytes contained in the original HTML document.
